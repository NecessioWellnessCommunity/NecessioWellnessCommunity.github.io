We are Necessio Wellness Community, an organization dedicated to rewriting the narrative of mental health through compassion and action. Since our inception in 2022, we've been driven by a shared commitment to address the plight of underprivileged individuals living with mental illness and those struggling with mental health challenges. With our formal registration in 2024, our resolve to champion the right to mental health has only strengthened.

At Necessio, we understand that to truly make a difference, we must address the root cause of stigma. That's why we're passionate about sensitizing communities about mental health issues from the grassroots level up. By fostering understanding, acceptance, and empathy, we aim to create a culture where individuals living with mental illness feel supported and valued, free from the burden of stigma. 

We are also keen on promoting occupational justice by advocating for equitable access to opportunities that allow people to engage in activities that contribute to their health, well-being, and quality of life by addressing social, economic, and cultural barriers. Join us as we continue to shape a future where mental health is met with compassion and dignity for all.

# Objectives

1. Educate society about mental health and the rights of people living with mental illnesses to help reduce the stigma. This includes promoting occupational justice by highlighting the importance of equitable opportunities for meaningful engagement in activities.

2. Advocate for the right to freedom from inhumane treatment for people living with mental illnesses.

3. Improve the quality of life of stranded and underprivileged individuals living with mental illnesses and experiencing mental health challenges by donating essential items, providing emotional support.

## Relevance

Mental health challenges affect people from all walks of life, yet there remains a pervasive stigma around seeking help. This stigma often stems from a lack of awareness and understanding, which can prevent individuals from accessing the care and support they need. At Necessio Wellness Community, we see this as a critical issue to address.

Our relevance lies in our ability to bridge the gap between mental health awareness and action. We focus on reaching underserved populationsâ€”those who are often marginalized and left without access to adequate mental health resources. By working at the grassroots level, we engage communities directly, ensuring that mental health education is accessible, relatable, and practical. Through our efforts, we aim to reduce stigma, foster supportive environments, and promote a deeper understanding of mental health issues.

In a society where mental health concerns are often overlooked, Necessio is at the forefront of the movement to make mental well-being a priority, ensuring that every individual, regardless of their background, receives the compassion and care they deserve.
